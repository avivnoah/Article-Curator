## Installation

### Steps:
###### 1. Clone the repository.
###### 2. Navigate to the project directory
###### 3. Make sure you set up the correct mongoDB address & the right dependencies
#### Installation note: to make sure you can use the library_install.bat file, you need to make sure your pip & python Path environment system variables are "correlated". or install them manually, but it's not as fun.

```bash
  pip install concurrent playwright_stealth pytest-playwright multiprocessing time sys
```
